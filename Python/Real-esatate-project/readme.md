# Gurgaon Real Estate Price Prediction

## Project Overview

The **Gurgaon Real Estate Price Prediction** project analyzes and predicts property prices for flats and homes across various sectors in Gurgaon. By leveraging machine learning techniques, it provides insights into property valuation, helping buyers, sellers, and investors make informed decisions.

## Features

* Predicts property prices based on features like location, area, bedrooms, and amenities.
* Provides sector-wise price insights for flats and independent homes.
* Helps users understand trends in Gurgaon's real estate market.
* Optional interactive interface for predictions.

## Data

* Dataset includes historical property listings from various Gurgaon sectors.
* Key attributes:

  * `Sector`: Sector number or name
  * `Property Type`: Flat / Home
  * `Area`: Square feet of property
  * `Bedrooms`: Number of bedrooms
  * `Amenities`: Features like parking, gym, etc.
  * `Price`: Market price of the property

## Technology Stack

* **Python** – Core programming
* **Pandas, NumPy** – Data preprocessing and manipulation
* **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning models
* **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Data visualization
* **Optional:** Streamlit / Flask for interactive web app

## Model

* Trained regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest) to predict property prices.
* Evaluated using RMSE, MAE, and R² score.
* Sector-wise predictions for localized insights.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anshhchaurasiya/my_projects/tree/main/Python/Real-esatate-project
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook / Python script to explore data and make predictions.
4. (Optional) Launch the Streamlit app:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Insights & Results

* Predicted prices are highly correlated with location, area, and bedrooms.
* Certain sectors show higher appreciation trends due to proximity to commercial hubs and metro connectivity.
* Visualizations highlight price distribution and sector-wise comparison.

## Future Work

* Incorporate real-time data for up-to-date predictions.
* Develop a full-fledged interactive web app for end-users.
* Extend prediction to rental prices and commercial properties.
